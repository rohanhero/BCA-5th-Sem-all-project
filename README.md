# BCA-5th-Sem-all-project

Hello, This is for all BCA 5th sem students
Important:
- All code inside the files are commented beacuse of lame project hierarchy system of this old language which is giving only one entry point
- To run these code you need to
    - Copy code and paste on online compiler by uncommenting it here: **https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/online-compiler/**
    - You must know the basics of C# and how the dotnet file folder hierarchy works.
    - Happy Coding !
